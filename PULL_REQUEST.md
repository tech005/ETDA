# Pull Request: Major ETDA Bot Enhancements

## Summary
This PR introduces significant improvements to the ETDA bot including a revolutionary State Manager interface, advanced healing capabilities, dynamic priority management, and comprehensive UI enhancements.

## ðŸš€ Key Features Added

### 1. Advanced Healing Bot System
- **Multi-target healing**: Self, party members, and named players
- **Smart health detection**: Automatic low health percentage detection
- **Flexible spell selection**: Support for all healing spells with automatic name cleaning
- **Priority-based healing**: Critical health gets priority, then by health percentage
- **Configurable healing range** and **named player targeting**

### 2. Revolutionary State Manager Interface
- **Split-panel design**: States list + control panels
- **Real-time filtering**: Search states by name
- **Priority grouping**: Visual priority level organization
- **One-click state management**: Easy enable/disable with visual indicators
- **Configuration persistence**: Per-player XML-based config system
- **Integrated bot controls**: Pause/resume directly from interface

### 3. Dynamic Priority Management System
- **Logical priority hierarchy**: Emergency â†’ Healing â†’ Combat â†’ Buffs â†’ Movement
- **StateAttribute enhancement**: Added DefaultPriority parameter
- **Automatic priority application**: Smart defaults for all states
- **User override capability**: Manual priority adjustment with UI controls

### 4. Enhanced User Experience
- **Resizable windows**: Modern window controls and larger default size
- **Auto tab switching**: Settings button automatically navigates to configuration
- **Professional UI**: Modern flat design with color coding
- **State Manager as default tab**: Primary bot interface immediately accessible

## ðŸ“Š Impact

### Before:
- Basic state management in cluttered interface
- Manual priority management with no clear hierarchy  
- Limited healing capabilities (basic spell casting only)
- Fixed window size with UI cutoff issues
- No configuration persistence

### After:
- Professional state management interface with filtering and grouping
- Logical priority system with visual management tools
- Advanced healing system with multi-target support and intelligence
- Resizable windows with improved layouts and navigation
- Per-player configuration persistence with XML storage

## ðŸ”§ Technical Improvements

- **Comprehensive error handling**: Deferred initialization, null safety, graceful degradation
- **Modern UI patterns**: Split containers, event-driven updates, LINQ optimization
- **Configuration system**: Reflection-based property persistence with type safety
- **Memory efficiency**: Lazy loading, resource pooling, optimized state management

## ðŸ“‹ Files Changed

### New Files:
- `BotCore/BotForms/StateManager.cs` (826 lines) - Main state management interface
- `BotCore/BotForms/StateManager.Designer.cs` (667 lines) - UI layout
- `BotCore/BotForms/StateManager.resx` - UI resources  
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Comprehensive documentation

### Modified Files:
- `BotCore/States/BotStates/HealingBot.cs` - Complete rewrite (300+ lines)
- `BotCore/States/BotStates/StateAttribute.cs` - Added DefaultPriority
- `BotCore/BotForms/BotInterface.cs` - StateManager integration
- `BotCore/BotForms/BotInterface.Designer.cs` - UI sizing and layout
- **All bot state files** - Updated with logical default priorities

## ðŸŽ¯ User Benefits

1. **Intuitive bot management** - Visual interface replaces complex configuration
2. **Intelligent healing** - Advanced multi-target healing with smart targeting
3. **Logical state priorities** - Emergency functions run before movement/buffs
4. **Configuration persistence** - Settings saved per character automatically
5. **Professional appearance** - Modern UI with proper window management

## âœ… Testing Completed
